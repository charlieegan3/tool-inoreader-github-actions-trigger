# tool-inoreader-github-actions-trigger

`inoreader-github-actions-trigger` is a tool to catch webhooks from Inoreader rule events and forward them in the
correct format to trigger GH actions jobs.

The tool is designed to be loaded into a [toolbelt](https://github.com/charlieegan3/toolbelt) instance.

I use this in my [DIY YouTube offline system](https://charlieegan3.com/posts/2022-07-15-creating-a-diy-offline-youtube-watch-list/).
